* meme reactions e.g. *YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER*
* public link of judgement so that other people can comment
* way to send link to other party, and they can enter their perspective, get an individual judgement and then based on both views get a common judgement + advice for conflict resolution. 
* multi agent voting + one final verdict 
    * having multiple personas e.g. sassy genZ chick, based gym bro, geek, mom, dad, etc.
    * using all opinions, let one unbiased model make the final verdict. 
    * let the user also view the verdicts of the individual personas
